### heart disease Classification Project

### Overview
This project focuses on automating the process of classifying software requirements into functional and non-functional categories using machine learning algorithms. By streamlining the early phases of software development, the goal is to improve project management efficiency and ensure adherence to software quality standards. Additionally, Hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV was utilized to optimize the performance of the machine learning models.

### Models
Several machine learning models have been developed and evaluated using Scikit-learn, including:

1. K-Nearest Neighbours classifier
2. Logistic Regression
3. Random Forest Classifier
The models' performance was compared based on accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score to identify the most effective algorithm for classifying software requirements.
