### heart disease Classification Project
### Overview
This project focuses on automating the process of categorizing software requirements into functional and non-functional types using machine learning techniques. By streamlining the early phases of software development, the project aims to boost efficiency in project management while ensuring adherence to software quality standards.
### Dataset

### Models
Several machine learning models have been developed and evaluated using Scikit-learn, including:

* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Decision Trees (with and without AdaBoost)
The models' performance was compared based on accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score to identify the most effective algorithm for classifying software requirements.
